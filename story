once upon a time there were two animals in the jungle one was a fast but egoistic rabbit and another one was a calm slow turtle
they had a bet about who will win a marathon race
the rabbit said- ohh poor turtle you are very slw and staedy im having a pitty on you
the turtle said- do not worry my friend the time will tell that whos gonna win today
the race started between the two..for the first 10-15 mins the rabbit didnt even took a step and the rabbit was thinking that the turtle is one of the slwest animal in the whole jungle and could he compete the fast hopping rabbit
in all that time the turtle made it up to the finish line..nd guess what ?..the most steady animal in the jungle won the race with the help of his confidence and calm mind
the rabbit had a huge regret upon his egoistic thinking...
